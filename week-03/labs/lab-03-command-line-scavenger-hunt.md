# Week 3 Lab 03 — Command Line Scavenger Hunt (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Yaerelin Molina

**Date Completed:**

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 3  
**Submission Path:** `week-03/labs/lab-03-command-line-scavenger-hunt.md`

## Overview

Labs 01 and 02 walked you through each command step by step. This lab is Week 3's wrap-up challenge: a deeper, more independent folder structure with three hidden files to track down, using the navigating and reading commands from Lessons 3A/3B, the creating and organizing commands from Lesson 3C, and your own judgment about when to ask for help. There's less hand-holding here on purpose — this is your chance to prove to yourself that the blinking cursor from the start of Lesson 3A doesn't intimidate you anymore.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** Same consequence-free CLI Simulator as Labs 01 and 02. Getting "lost" in the folder tree costs you nothing but a few extra `cd` moves.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | Your choice — bash or PowerShell |
| Prerequisite | Labs 01 and 02 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 3 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"Foundry District Archive Room"** scenario. This tree goes several folders deeper than Labs 01 and 02, and includes a few similarly-named folders on purpose — read carefully before you `cd` into anything.

---

## Part A — The Hunt

Find all three of the following, hidden at different depths in the Archive Room tree:

- A file related to a **shift log**
- A file related to a **maintenance note**
- A file related to a **supply inventory**

For each one, use `pwd`/`Get-Location` and `ls`/`dir` as many times as you need while you search, then record the **full path** once you find it.

Shift log file — full path once found:

```
/home/archivist/operations/ops-log/shift-log.txt
```

Maintenance note file — full path once found:

```
/home/archivist/records/records-2025
```

Supply inventory file — full path once found:

```
/home/archivist/records/records-2024
```

---

## Part B — Read and Report

For each of the three files you found in Part A, use `cat`/`type` to read it and record what it says.

Shift log contents:

```
Shift Log - Foundry District Archive Room
07:00 - Archive opened, no incidents overnight.
15:00 - Routine filing complete. 
```

Maintenance note contents:

```
Maintenance Note - Conveyor belt 3 serviced, next check due in 90 days. 
```

Supply inventory contents:

```
Supply Inventory - Q4 2024
Gloves - 400 units
Masks - 250 units
Tape - 60 rolls
```

---

## Part C — Organize Your Findings

Now that you've located and read all three files, clean up after yourself the way a professional would — don't leave your findings scattered across the tree.

### Step 1 — Create a Sorted-Findings Folder

Create a new folder called `sorted-findings` in your home directory.

Command you ran:

```
mkdir sorted-findings
```

### Step 2 — Move All Three Files Into It

Move the shift log, maintenance note, and supply inventory files — the same three you found in Part A — into `sorted-findings`.

Commands you ran:

```
mv operations/ops-log/shift-log.txt sorted-findings/
mv records/records-2025/maintenance-note.txt sorted-findings/
mv records/records-2024/supply-inventory.txt sorted-findings/ 

```

### Step 3 — Confirm the Move

List the contents of `sorted-findings` to confirm all three files are now there.

Command you ran:

```
ls sorted-findings
```

Output:

```
maintenance-note.txt shift-log.txt supply-inventory.txt
```

---

## Part D — When You Get Stuck

At some point in the Archive Room, you'll likely run across a command or folder name you don't immediately recognize.

### Step 1 — Ask the Terminal

When that happens, use `--help`, `man`, or `Get-Help` instead of guessing. Record what you looked up and what you learned.

Command or term you looked up:

```
man chmod
```

What the help text (or the folder's contents) told you:

```
chmod MODE FILE... - change file mode bits (e.g. chmod 755 file).
chmod controls who is allowed to read, write, or run a file
```

### Step 2 — Describe a Wrong Turn

Everyone takes at least one wrong turn in a tree this size. Describe one moment you ended up somewhere unexpected, and how you used `pwd`/`Get-Location` and `cd ..` to recover.

```
I made the mistake of moving my sorted-findings directory into my records directory instead of moving the note files into the sorted-findings directory. After checking my location with pwd and reviewing the directory structure, I realized the mistake and corrected it by navigating to the appropriate directory before running the mv command again. 
```

## Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1

Which of the three files in Part A took the longest to find, and what was it about the tree's structure (depth, similarly-named folders, etc.) that made it harder?

```
The shift-log.txt took the longest to find because it was stored in a different location than the other files. I had to go back and forth between the operations and records directories since the records were grouped together in one location, while the shift log was located separately under operations/ops-log. This highlighted the importance of paying close attention to file paths.
```

### Analysis Question 2

Compare how you felt starting this lab to how you felt at the very start of Lesson 3A, looking at a blank blinking cursor for the first time. What changed?

```
I began this lab feeling more confident because I had previously taken a Linux Bash course and assumed I would remember most of the commands. However, I quickly realized that I had passively brushed over many of the foundational concepts just to get through the course, so I had to revisit and relearn basic navigation and file management commands along the way. As I worked through the lab, those concepts became much clearer. It's not about memorizing these commands, it's about understanding the reasoning behind each command. I now look forward to continue strengthening my Bash and PowerShell skills. 
```

### Analysis Question 3

Week 4 moves from managing your own files to controlling who's allowed to do what to them — permissions — plus your first look at what a virtual machine is. Based on everything you've practiced this week, what's one thing you're curious about or looking forward to?

```
I want to become more confident using chmod and learn when it's appropriate to use it compared to Access Control Lists (ACLs). I'm also looking forward to learning about sticky bits and how they affect shared directories. 
```

## GitHub Commit Subsection

Same mechanism as Labs 01 and 02: fill out this lab's worksheet in the **CyberFoundations Lab Portal** (Week 3 → Lab 03) and click **Submit to GitHub** — the Portal commits the completed file to `week-03/labs/lab-03-command-line-scavenger-hunt.md` automatically. No manual typing or commit needed.

**📌 Optional:** a CLI Simulator session screenshot can be added the same way as Labs 01 and 02 — upload to `assets/screenshots/week-03/`, then right-click the uploaded image and choose **Copy image address**/**Copy Image Link** to embed it — but it isn't required and won't affect your grade.
