# Week 2 Lab — Cybersecurity Landscape & Digital Infrastructure Overview

**Student Name:** Yaerelin Molina

**Date Completed:**

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 2  
**Submission Path:** `week-02/labs/lab-01-hardware-os-software-diagram.md`

## Overview

In this lab, you build a working mental model of the system you'll be securing throughout this course: the hardware, operating system, and software layers that make up every computer, and where the cybersecurity field fits around them. This lab has two parts. Part A connects this week's material to the CyberFoundations City map. Part B has you build and explain a diagram of how a computer's hardware, OS, and software layers interact.

**No terminal or command line is required this week** — that starts in Week 3.

## Part A — CyberFoundations City & the Cybersecurity Landscape

The CyberFoundations City map is your visual guide to the next 11 weeks. Each district represents a module of this course. This part connects this week's material to the map you were introduced to in Week 1.

### Step 1 — Open the Lab Portal Orientation Module

Log into the Lab Portal with your Microsoft account. From your Student Dashboard, open the **Module 1 orientation** module.

### Step 2 — Complete the Orientation Walkthrough

Work through the orientation content. It covers the same hardware/OS/software material as this week's lessons from a different angle — use it to check your understanding, not to replace the lessons.

### Step 3 — Locate This Week's District on the City Map

Open the CyberFoundations City map (introduced in Week 1, Lesson 6). Identify which district corresponds to Module 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI.

**District name:** Foundry District

```
Foundry District
```

**Why this district fits this week's topics (1–2 sentences):**

```
Some of this week's topics includes digital infrastructure, hardware and software components, and the threat landscape. 
```

## Part B — Hardware, OS, and Software Diagram

A computer is a stack of layers: physical hardware at the bottom, an operating system managing that hardware in the middle, and the software you actually use on top. This part has you draw that stack and explain it in your own words.

### Step 1 — Identify the Layers

Before drawing anything, list the three layers you'll diagram and one example of what lives at each layer.

**Hardware layer — one example component:** storage

```
(e.g., CPU, RAM, storage — your choice)
```

**Operating system layer — name an OS:**

```
(e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
```

**Software layer — one example application:** macOS

```
(e.g., a web browser, a word processor)
```

### Step 2 — Sketch Your Diagram

Sketch a simple diagram (hand-drawn and photographed, or built in any digital tool) showing how the hardware, OS, and software layers stack and interact. Arrows or labels showing "what talks to what" matter more than visual polish. If you'd like a free browser-based option instead of hand-drawing, try [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) — no account required to get started.

### Step 3 — Upload and Embed Your Diagram

Upload your diagram image directly into your repo's assets folder — keep it there rather than pasting it loose into this file, so all of this week's images stay together and organized.

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-02/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, then drag in your diagram image, and give it a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces, no timestamps — e.g. `hardware-os-software-diagram.png`).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click on the uploaded image's filename to open it — you'll see the image itself displayed on the page.
5. Right-click directly on the image and choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox).
6. Come back to this file, open the pencil (edit) icon, and paste that link into the embed line below, in place of the placeholder:

```markdown
![Hardware/OS/software diagram](paste your copied image link here)
```

**If right-click doesn't show that option:** click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

**My Diagram:** https://github.com/sudoyae/yaerelin-molina-cyberfoundations-portfolio/blob/main/assets/screenshots/week-02/lab-01-hardware-os-software-diagram.jpg

### Step 4 — Explain Your Diagram

In your own words — not a copied definition — explain how the three layers interact. Reference your own diagram directly.

```
In my diagram, the software is like the customer because it requests a service. The operating system is like the waiter because it takes the request from Google Chrome and communicates it to the hardware. The hardware, represented by the Intel Core i5 CPU, is like the chef because it performs the actual work of processing instructions. Once the work is complete, the results travel back through the operating system to Google Chrome so I can see and interact with the webpage. 
```

## Analysis Questions

Answer each question in your own words. These questions connect what you did in Parts A and B to the bigger picture of this course.

### Analysis Question 1

If the operating system crashed on the computer you diagrammed, which layer(s) would stop working, and which (if any) would keep working? Explain your reasoning.

```
The hardware would keep working, however, would be used inefficiently. The software stops working overall because it can no longer communicate with the hardware layer since the communication isn't there anymore. 
```

### Analysis Question 2

Pick one piece of software you use daily. Trace it down through the OS to the hardware it ultimately depends on. What would happen to that software if the hardware layer failed?

```
If the hardware layer failed, the software would stop working because it depends on the hardware to perform its tasks. Even if Google Chrome is still installed, it would not be able to open or be of use without the working hardware. 
```

### Analysis Question 3

Explain, in your own words, why a cybersecurity professional needs to understand all three layers — hardware, OS, and software — rather than just the software layer where most visible attacks (like phishing emails) happen.

```
A cybersecurity professional need to understand all layers because they all work together as a team to ensure the computer functions. A security issue may occur at any of these layers. By understanding how the three layers communicate and depend on each other, you can better identify where an attack started or how it spread through. Furthermore, if it does spread, you can find the best approach to prevent and respond to it.

## Lab Report Questions

Answer each question in complete sentences.

**1. What is the cybersecurity landscape, and why does it matter to someone starting this course?**

```
If the operating system crashed, the software would stop working because applications and programs depend on the OS to access files, network, and hardware. Without the OS, it would be difficult to demand the hardware for change. Although the hardware layer would continue working, the OS is responsible for controlling it. For example, the storage and ram is still physically there but cannot be allocated else where. Any new work that has not yet been saved to storage will likely be lost because the operating system is no longer able to manage applications. Communication is lost.
```

**2. Which CyberFoundations City district did you identify in Part A, and how does its theme connect to the hardware/OS/software material in Part B?**

```
I use Google Chrome everyday and runs on my macOS, which depends on SSD storage and RAM. If RAM fails, then the tabs would fail to open. If SSD storage fails, chrome would not load either. The hardware that executes functions and processes is the central processing unit (CPU) which would no longer execute instructions if it were to fail. 
```

**3. Of the three layers (hardware, OS, software), which one do you think is hardest to secure, and why?**

```
Focusing on only the software layer such as phishing attacks can hinder your ability to determine other potential threats in the hardware and operating system layer. Learning all three layers is important because they're interconnected and depend on one another to function. For example, the software relies on the operating system to communicate with the hardware layer. The operating system also relies on the hardware to store data and execute functions. Cybersecurity professionals can understand how malware can exploit the operating system which then leaves the hardware components vulnerable. 
```
