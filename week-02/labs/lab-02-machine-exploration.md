## Overview

Lab 01 got you diagramming how hardware, OS, and software interact — in theory. This lab makes it real, in one sitting. First, you'll look up your own machine's actual specs (OS version, RAM, storage) using its built-in settings screens. Then you'll open Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) and watch those same hardware and software layers working together live — CPU usage, memory usage, and real running processes — and connect what you see back to your Lab 01 diagram.

**No terminal or command line is required this week** — that starts in Week 3. Settings screens, Task Manager, and Activity Monitor are all point-and-click tools.

## Lab Environment

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Your own computer (Windows or Mac) — no VM, no cloud, no install needed |
| Required Materials | Your computer's built-in Settings/About screen; Task Manager (Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`) or Activity Monitor (Mac: `Cmd+Space`, then type "Activity Monitor") |

**Prerequisite:** Lab 01 completed — you'll reference your diagram in this lab's Analysis Questions.

## Part A — Find Your Real Specs

**Before you start:** here's what to expect so you don't second-guess yourself. On Windows, you're looking for a page titled **About**, reached via **Settings → System → About**, listing your device specs under "Device specifications." On Mac, you're looking for a window titled **About This Mac** (click the Apple menu, top-left corner), with an Overview tab listing your chip, memory, and macOS version. If what's on your screen doesn't roughly match that, you're in the wrong menu — try again before recording anything below.

### Step 1 — Find Your OS Version

Open your computer's system settings (Windows: **Settings → System → About**. Mac: **Apple menu → About This Mac**) and find the exact operating system name and version you're running.

**OS and version:** 

```
macOS Sequoia 15.7.7
```

### Step 2 — Check Your Installed RAM

On the same settings screen, find how much RAM (memory) is installed on your computer.

**Installed RAM:** 8 GB

```
RAM 8G available
```

### Step 3 — Check Your Available Storage

Find your computer's total storage capacity and how much is currently free (Windows: **Settings → System → Storage**. Mac: **About This Mac → Storage**).

**Total storage:** 499.96

```
Storage has 499.96 GB. I used 199.37 GB, leaving with 300.59 GB available.
```

**Free storage:** 300.59

```
300.59 GB available.
```

## Part B — Watch It Live

Your Part A numbers are a snapshot. This part shows those same layers actually working, moment to moment.

### Step 1 — Open Task Manager or Activity Monitor

Windows: press `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`. Mac: press `Cmd+Space`, type "Activity Monitor," and press Enter.

### Step 2 — Find the Performance / CPU Tab

Windows: click the **Performance** tab. Mac: click the **CPU** tab.

### Step 3 — Freeze the List Before You Read It

The process list updates constantly and can be hard to read while it's jumping around. Before recording anything, click the **Name** column header (or **Memory**, if you'd rather sort by what's using the most RAM) to sort the list — this won't stop it from updating, but it keeps things from reordering under you while you read.

### Step 4 — Record CPU Usage

Look at the current CPU usage percentage.

```
Current CPU usage: 3.02%
```

### Step 5 — Record Memory Usage

Find how much RAM is currently in use, out of your total installed RAM (the same total you looked up in Part A).

```
RAM in use: 6.38 GB out of total: 8 GB
```

### Step 6 — List Five Running Processes

List five processes running right now. For each, write your best guess at what it is or does — you don't need to be 100% correct, just reason it out. If you spot something on the cheat sheet below, you can use that, but try at least a couple you don't recognize.

**Cheat sheet — common processes you'll likely see (not exhaustive, just a starting reference):**

| Process Name | Usually Seen On | What It Generally Is |
|---|---|---|
| explorer.exe | Windows | The Windows desktop and file browser itself — normal, always running |
| svchost.exe | Windows | A generic host for background Windows services — several running at once is normal |
| Antimalware Service Executable | Windows | Windows Defender scanning files in the background — normal |
| dwm.exe | Windows | Desktop Window Manager — handles visual effects like transparency and window animations |
| System Idle Process | Windows | Not a real program — represents how much CPU is doing *nothing* right now |
| WindowServer | Mac | Manages everything drawn on your screen — always running |
| Finder | Mac | The Mac desktop and file browser itself — normal, always running |
| mdworker / mds | Mac | Spotlight's background indexing service — normal, can spike briefly after installing apps |
| launchd | Mac | The very first process Mac starts — manages and launches other background services |

```
1. Process name: Google Chrome          What I think it does: browser application 
2. Process name: WindowServer           What I think it does: displays desktop images
3. Process name: Activity Monitor       What I think it does: shows CPU and RAM processes
4. Process name: kernel_task            What I think it does: communicates between operating system and hardware system. 
5. Process name: Google Chrome Helper   What I think it does: Runs individual Chrome webpages to improve preformance. 
```

### Step 7 — Screenshot and Embed

Take a screenshot of Task Manager or Activity Monitor showing your CPU/memory usage and process list.

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-02/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, then drag in your screenshot, and give it a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces — e.g. `machine-exploration.png`).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click on the uploaded image's filename to open it — you'll see the image itself displayed on the page.
5. Right-click directly on the image and choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox).
6. Come back to this file, open the pencil (edit) icon, and paste that link into the embed line below, in place of the placeholder:

```markdown
![Task Manager / Activity Monitor screenshot](paste your copied image link here)
```

**If right-click doesn't show that option:** click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

### Step 8 — Connect the Numbers

In your own words, explain how the real numbers you found in Part A (OS version, RAM, storage) relate to what you just watched live in Part B. Which number describes hardware, and which describes the OS?

```
When I opened the Activity Monitor on my macOS, it shows the OS managing processes like kernal_task, WindowServer, and Google Chrome. The operating system decides how much CPU time and memory chrome or WindowServer receives. Overall memory used is 6.38 GB while the App memory used is 2.54 GB, and cached files is 1.70 GB. The physical memory itself contains 8 GB. 
```

## Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1

Pick one process from your list in Part B, Step 6. Is it "software" in the sense Lab 01 used that word? Explain how it depends on the OS and on hardware to actually run.

```
I chose Google Chrome as my process because it is a software I mostly use on my computer. Google Chrome depends on macOS to provide access to hardware resources such as memory, CPU, and storage. In order for Google to load webpages, the operating system manages the communication between software and hardware layers. 
```

### Analysis Question 2

Your CPU usage number changes constantly, even when you're not doing anything. Explain, in your own words, why watching this number matters for security work — not just for performance. (Hint: think about what it might mean if a process you don't recognize suddenly spikes CPU usage.)

```
CPU usage changes because different programs and system processes are constantly running in the background. It's important for cybersecurity professionals to know due to the fact that an unknown process could suddenly take a large percentage of CPU. This sudden indication could be due to malware, software, or other unrecognizable programs. By noticing these small details, we can investigate whether or not the activity is safe to use. 
```

### Analysis Question 3

Compare what you saw in Task Manager/Activity Monitor to the diagram you built in Lab 01. What's the same? What did watching your machine live show you that a static diagram couldn't?

```
Applications such as Google Chrome were running as software processes, while macOS managed how they used hardware resources like the CPU and RAM. The difference is that my diagram was a simple illustration, but Activity Monitor demonstrated stats in real time. I could see the CPU and memory usage constantly fluctuating which is something the diagram cannot show.
