# Week 7 Lab 01 — Meet the Guard

**Student Name:** Yaerelin Molina

**Date Completed:**

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 7  
**Submission Path:** `week-07/labs/lab-01-meet-the-guard.md`

> ## Cloud Heights Protected-Rules Safety Rule
> Four baseline rules are protected: **100** (`allow-ssh-from-bastion`), **110** (`allow-icmp-intra-vnet`), **120** (`deny-ssh-student-subnet`), and **1000** (`deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` — Inbound Deny TCP from `10.60.6.0/26` to port `8080`). **You never modify, delete, replace, or use a protected rule as a troubleshooting target.** Create or edit student rules only in priorities **200–999**. The priority **1000** fallback deny sits after your band on purpose, so a narrower Allow you create in 200–999 is evaluated first. A mistake in your student range is recoverable and is not a grading penalty when you diagnose it honestly.

> **Evidence safety:** Never include a Cloud Heights password or Bastion shareable URL. Crop browser address bars and login information before committing screenshots.

## Mission

Inspect the existing NIC-level security rules on your assigned VM without changing anything. Your goal is to recognize the guardrails, separate protected rules from student-editable space, and map each visible field to the firewall mental model.

## What You Already Know

A network security rule is a decision about traffic. Rules are evaluated from the lowest priority number to the highest, and the first matching rule wins. Inbound and outbound traffic use separate ledgers. A configured service, a security rule, a test result, and an evidence screenshot answer different questions.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | My Lab Environment → Cloud Heights → Security Rules |
| Change level | Read-only; do not add, edit, or delete rules |
| Expected protected rules | 100 `allow-ssh-from-bastion`; 110 `allow-icmp-intra-vnet`; 120 `deny-ssh-student-subnet`; 1000 `deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` |
| Time | 15–20 minutes |

- [x] I am using my assigned `cf-student-XX` VM through the CyberFoundations Lab Portal.

- [x] The VM shows **Running**.

- [x] I can identify the four protected baseline rules at priorities 100, 110, 120, and 1000.

- [x] I understand that my editable priority range is 200–999.

### Cloud Heights Idle Stop

Cloud Heights may warn you that the VM is idle. Return to the Lab Portal and choose **I'm still working** if you are active. If the VM is stopped or deallocated, it was not deleted: restart it from **My Lab Environment**. Your disk files and saved configuration remain.

## Predict First

Before opening the rule list, predict why a course environment would protect its access and safety rules from student edits.

```text
A course environment would protect its access and safety rules so students do not accidentally change an important rule and lock themselves out of their VM or interfere with other students' machines. The protected rules keep necessary access, such as SSH through Bastion, working while maintaining security and isolation between student systems. Students can still practice safely by creating their own rules in the 200–999 priority range
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Open the Guard Post

Start your VM from **My Lab Environment** first. The **Live Azure lab** card is only a launcher — all rule work happens in the Lab Portal's **Security Rules** panel. Do not work in the Azure Portal.

In Cloud Heights, scroll **below** the yellow *Protected rules — do not modify* summary to the detailed list headed **INBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER**. That detailed list, not the yellow summary, is what you inventory and capture.

### Step 2 — Inventory the Baseline

Record each protected rule exactly as shown.

| Priority | Rule name | Direction | Protocol | Source | Destination/port | Action | Protected? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | allow-ssh-from-bastion | Inbound | TCP | 192.168.10.128/26 | * / 22 | Allow | Yes |
| 110 | allow-icmp-intra-vnet | Inbound | ICMP | VirtualNetwork | * / * | Allow | Yes |
| 120 | deny-ssh-student-subnet | Inbound | TCP | 10.60.6.0/26 | * / 22 | Deny | Yes |
| 1000 | deny-tcp8080-student-subnet | Inbound | TCP | 10.60.6.0/26 | * / 8080 | Deny | Yes |

### Step 3 — Map the Fields

For each field, write the question it answers: direction, source, source port, destination, destination port, protocol, action, and priority.

```text
Direction: Is the traffic coming into my VM or going out of my VM?
Source: Where is the traffic coming from?
Source port: Which port is the traffic coming from?
Destination: Where is the traffic trying to go?
Destination port: Which port or service is the traffic trying to reach?
Protocol: What type of traffic is being used, such as TCP or ICMP?
Action: Should the traffic be allowed or denied?
Priority: In what order should the rule be checked?
```

## Stop & Check

- Can you edit a protected rule? You should not be able to — all four are locked.
- Where may student rules be created? Priorities 200–999.
- Which value is read first: 200 or 900? The lower number, 200.

## Test

This is a read-only lab: do not add, edit, or delete any rule. Your test is visual verification — confirm all four protected rules remain present and that no student rule was created.

## Capture Evidence

Capture the detailed **INBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER** view showing all four protected rules (100, 110, 120, 1000) and no student rule. If it does not fit in one image, use two clearly named images and explain why.

## Explain

In 3–4 sentences, explain how protected baselines and a separate student priority band reduce accidental lockout while still allowing meaningful practice.

```text
Protected baseline rules reduce accidental lockout by preventing students from changing important rules that keep the lab secure and accessible. For example, priority 100, allow-ssh-from-bastion, is protected so I cannot accidentally change it and lose my SSH access to the VM. At the same time, the separate student priority range of 200–999 allows me to practice creating and testing my own security rules, such as rules controlling TCP port 8080. This gives me hands-on practice without risking the important baseline configuration.
```

## Required Evidence

Save screenshots in `assets/screenshots/week-07/`:

- `week07-lab01-security-rules-baseline.png`

Open each image at full size before submission. Confirm that no password, Bastion shareable URL, browser address bar, or unrelated private information is visible.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Why is a priority number part of rule behavior rather than just an identifier? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
A priority number is part of a rule's behavior because it determines the order in which the security rules are evaluated. Lower priority numbers are checked first, and once traffic matches a rule, that rule's Allow or Deny action is applied and the rules below it are not checked. For example, a student Allow rule between priorities 200–999 could be evaluated before the priority 1000 deny rule for TCP port 8080, which could change whether that traffic is allowed.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Explain the difference between a rule being visible, editable, and protected. (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
A visible rule is a rule that I can see and review, including information such as its priority, protocol, source, port, and action. An editable rule is one that I am allowed to create or change, which in Cloud Heights is limited to student priorities 200–999. A protected rule is visible but cannot be changed or deleted because it maintains important access and security settings, such as the protected rules at priorities 100, 110, 120, and 1000.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Which baseline rule protects your current administrative path, and why must it never be used as a troubleshooting target? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
The baseline rule that protects my current administrative path is priority 100, allow-ssh-from-bastion. It allows inbound TCP traffic on port 22 from the Bastion subnet 192.168.10.128/26, which allows me to use SSH to access my VM through Bastion. It should never be used as a troubleshooting target because changing or deleting it could break my administrative access and potentially lock me out of the VM.
```
