## Overview

Lab 01 handed you the tools. This lab hands you a problem and gets out of your way.

Somewhere on The Grid, something is down. Your job is not to guess which thing — your job is to **find out**, one rung at a time, and then write down what the evidence says. This is the first time in this course you're being asked to do real diagnostic work rather than follow a recipe, and it is a genuine skill. You already have everything you need.

**The method is the Ladder Rule from Lesson 4:**

1. **Check yourself** — do you have a valid address?
2. **Check your gateway** — can you get out of your own neighbourhood?
3. **Check the target by NAME.**
4. **Check the target by IP.**
5. **Trace the path.**

*Work outward, one rung at a time, and let the evidence pick the culprit.*

The reason the ladder exists is that instinct is a terrible investigator. Instinct wants to name a villain in the first thirty seconds — "it's DNS," "it's the firewall," "it's the router" — and then spend an hour proving itself right. Evidence is slower and it is correct. **Do not decide what is broken until Part E.** Run the rungs in order, record what each one actually said, and let the finding assemble itself.

You will also be told, partway through, what somebody else thinks the problem is. Treat that the way you'd treat any other claim: test it.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | **bash** throughout this lab |
| Prerequisite | Week 5, Lessons 1–4 completed; Lab 01 completed first (this lab assumes those tools) |
| Commands used | `ip addr`, `ip route`, `ping`, `dig`, `traceroute` |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 5 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"The Grid — Outage Response (Bash)"** scenario. It boots you into the same workstation you used in Lab 01, on the same segment, with the same gateway. Only one thing about The Grid has changed since yesterday. Find it.

---

## Part A — Establish Your Baseline

Rungs 1 and 2 of the ladder. It is tempting to skip straight to the thing users complained about — resist that. If you don't establish that *your own machine and your own way out are healthy*, then every failure you find afterwards is ambiguous. You won't know whether the target is broken or whether you are.

### Step 1 — Check Yourself

Confirm your workstation still holds a valid address on The Grid, and that you know where its traffic leaves from.

Run `ip addr` for your address, then `ip route` for your gateway — the same two commands you used in Lab 01. (Remember: addresses and routes live in different places, so it takes both.)

The full `ip addr` output:

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:1a:7c:44:0b:5e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.20.5.42/24 brd 10.20.5.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

The full `ip route` output:

```
default via 10.20.5.1 dev eth0
10.20.5.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.20.5.42
```

Your IPv4 address and default gateway, pulled out of those two results:

```
My computer's network IP is 10.20.5.42. My subnet is 10.20.5.0/24. I use eth0 to communicate with that network. If the destination isn't on that network, I send the packet to my default gateway, 10.20.5.1.
```

### Step 2 — Check Your Gateway

Ping your default gateway. This is the door out of your neighbourhood — if this fails, nothing past it means anything.

Command you ran:

```
ping 10.20.5.1
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING 10.20.5.1 (10.20.5.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.000 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.200 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.100 ms
64 bytes from grid-gateway (10.20.5.1): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=1.300 ms

--- 10.20.5.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.000/1.150/1.300/0.100 ms
```

### Step 3 — State What the Baseline Proves

Two healthy results is not "nothing happened." It's a finding, and it eliminates an entire category of causes before you've touched the target once.

What your baseline rules out, and why that matters before you go further:

```
Because there was 0% packet loss, all packets were transmitted and received successfully. This baseline matters because this evidence determines that the issue is not the computer network. This will allow me to further investigate whether it is a firewall, port, application, etc.
```

---

## Part B — Test the Target

Rungs 3 and 4. This is the fork in the road, and the two tests must be run **in this order** and read **as a pair**. Either one alone tells you almost nothing. Together they tell you almost everything.

### Step 1 — Test the Target by Name

Ping `relay-station.grid.local` — the host the Foundry staff say they can't reach.

Command you ran:

```
ping relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- relay-station.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms
```

### Step 2 — Read That Output Carefully Before You Move On

There are two separate things happening in a ping, and this output separates them for you. Look at the **first line**, then look at the **summary line**, and notice that they do not agree about whether things are going well.

Did the name turn into an IP address — and if so, which one? Then: what did the packet loss say?

```
The first line demonstrated that the name turned into an IP address (10.20.5.30) Although the computer sent four ICMP ping requests, the computer received no ping replies. Due to no replies, there was a 100% packet loss.  
```

### Step 3 — Ask DNS Directly

Ping *told* you the name resolved, but it told you in passing, on one line, while it was busy doing something else. Ask the question on its own so the answer is unambiguous — and so you have it in writing when you escalate.

Run `dig relay-station.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
dig relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full dig result):

```
; <<>> DiG 9.18.24 <<>> relay-station.grid.local
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 41207
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;relay-station.grid.local.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
relay-station.grid.local.	3600	IN	A	10.20.5.30

;; Query time: 1 msec
```

Look at the `status:` field in the header and the `ANSWER SECTION`. Does DNS know this host, and if so, what address does it hand back?

What the status field said, and the A record it returned:

```
DNS A record successfully resolved relay-station.grid.local to the IP address 10.20.5.30. Therefore, DNS resolution does not appear to be the cause of the problem, so another issue may be preventing the machine from responding to the ping. 
```

This is the single most quotable piece of evidence in the whole investigation, because it settles a question your colleague is about to raise.

### Step 4 — Test the Target by IP

Now take the IP address out of that first line and ping it directly: `10.20.5.30`. You are deliberately removing name lookup from the equation.

Command you ran:

```
ping 10.20.5.30
```

Output (the full ping result, including the summary line):

```
PING 10.20.5.30 (10.20.5.30) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 10.20.5.30 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3005ms
```

### Step 5 — State What the Combination Proves

Now put the two results side by side. The by-name test and the by-IP test each had a job:

- The by-name test asks: *can this name be turned into a number, and does that number answer?*
- The by-IP test asks: *forget names entirely — does that number answer?*

Work through it. If the name failed to become a number, that would point one direction. If the name became a number just fine but the number won't answer, that points somewhere else entirely. And if you removed the name from the equation altogether and the failure **didn't change**, then whatever is broken was never about the name.

What the two tests together prove — and, just as importantly, what they rule out:

```
Using the two tests, pinging by hostname and by IP address both resulted in 100% packet loss. The hostname successfully resolved to 10.20.5.30, and directly pinging that IP address produced the same failure. As a result, DNS does not appear to be the cause. The evidence suggests that something along the network path may be preventing the ICMP replies from reaching the computer. 
```

---

## Part C — Trace the Path

Rung 5. Ping tells you *whether* something answers. Traceroute tells you *how far your traffic got before it stopped* — it lists each hop along the way, and a row of `* * *` means the path died at that point.

One traceroute on its own is hard to read if you've never seen a healthy one. So you'll run two, and compare.

### Step 1 — Trace to the Broken Target

Run `traceroute relay-station.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
traceroute relay-station.grid.local
```

Output (the full trace, including the timeout rows):

```
traceroute to relay-station.grid.local (10.20.5.30), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  * * *
  3  * * *
  4  * * *
  5  * * *
  6  * * *
  7  * * *
  8  * * *
```

The last hop that answered, and what happened after it:

```
The last responding hop ended at hop 1, where trace route reached the default grid-gateway. No responses were received from hops 2 to 8. 
```

### Step 2 — Trace to a Known-Good Target for Comparison

Now trace to a host you have no reason to suspect — `cloud-heights.grid.local`, out on the far edge of The Grid. (You'll be spending a lot of time in Cloud Heights next week. Consider this an introduction.)

Command you ran:

```
traceroute cloud-heights.grid.local
```

Output (the full trace):

```
traceroute to cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80), 8 hops max, 60 byte packets
  1  grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)  1.000 ms  1.200 ms  1.100 ms
  2  grid-core (10.20.0.1)  4.000 ms  4.200 ms  4.100 ms
  3  cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80)  12.000 ms  12.200 ms  12.100 ms
```

The complete list of hops, in order:

```
There is a total of 3 hops:
1. grid-gateway (10.20.5.1)
2. grid-core (10.20.0.1)
3. cloud-heights.grid.local (10.20.7.80)
```

### Step 3 — Compare the Two Traces

The comparison is the whole point of running two. One trace completed and one didn't — and where each one stopped is the evidence.

Pay attention to whether the **first hop** was the same in both. If traffic to the broken target and traffic to the healthy target both got through the same first hop successfully, that tells you something specific about which part of the path is fine.

What the comparison tells you about where the problem is — and where it is not:

```
Because both network traces reached the same first hop, grid-gateway (10.20.5.1). This shows that the connection between the computer and gateway is functioning, which indicates that the local network is responsive. The successful trace route continued to its destination.        The incomplete trace route received no responses after the gateway. The router is not necessarily broken, as it could be something else farther along the network path, such as a firewall rule or a device that does not respond to traceroute. 
```

## Part D — The Colleague's Theory

A more experienced colleague on the on-call channel reads your notes and jumps in:

> "Oh, I've seen this one. It's the relay station's DNS entry — it's `relay-station-old.grid.local` that everything actually points at, and that name is busted. This is a DNS problem, not a host problem. Go check it."

They sound confident. They may even be senior to you. **Test the claim anyway.** In security work, "somebody confident said so" is not evidence, and the fastest way to be respectfully wrong-footed is to accept a theory you could have checked in ten seconds.

### Step 1 — Test the Colleague's Host

Ping `relay-station-old.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
ping relay-station-old.grid.local
```

Output (the exact error or result — copy it precisely):

```
ping: relay-station-old.grid.local: Name or service not known
```

### Step 2 — Explain Why This Is a Different Kind of Failure

This result does **not** look like Part B. Compare them closely:

- In Part B, the name became a number, and then the packets went nowhere.
- Here, you never got a number at all.

Those are two genuinely different failures, at two different stages, and confusing them is one of the most common mistakes in network troubleshooting. In Lesson 2 you met the pair: **a name that doesn't resolve at all** versus **a name that resolves perfectly to a host that's dead**. One is the directory not having an entry. The other is the directory being completely correct about an address where nobody answers the door.

For context: `relay-station-old.grid.local` was decommissioned. It was retired on purpose, its directory entry was removed on purpose, and it has nothing to do with today's ticket. A retired name failing to resolve is *expected behaviour*, not an outage.

Explain, in your own words, why this failure is a different kind from the one in Part B — and why it is not the cause of today's outage:

```
The failure is different kind because the computer couldn't find an IP address for that hostname. The hostname successfully resolved to 10.20.5.30, but the host did not respond to the ping. The old hostname was intentionally decommissioned and its DNS entry was removed. In other words, you look up the name, find the correct address, but when you go there, nobody answers the door.
```

### Step 3 — Say How You'd Reply to Your Colleague

You now know they're wrong. Being right is easy; being useful about it is a professional skill. Write the reply you'd actually send — polite, specific, and grounded in what you ran rather than in who's more senior. Point at the evidence, not at the person.

Your reply to your colleague:

```
The two results are different because the computer could not find an IP address for the old hostname, while the earlier test successfully resolved the hostname to 10.20.5.30 but received no ping response. The result is expected because the DNS entry was intentionally removed. 
```

### Step 4 — One Control Test Before You Write It Up

You are about to tell people something is broken. Before you do, prove that *not everything* is broken — otherwise the first question you'll be asked is whether the problem is you.

Ping a host you already know is healthy: `foundry-archive.grid.local`.

Command you ran:

```
ping foundry-archive.grid.local 
```

Output (the full ping result):

```
PING foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.000 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=2.200 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=2.100 ms
64 bytes from foundry-archive.grid.local (10.20.5.20): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=2.300 ms

--- foundry-archive.grid.local ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 2.000/2.150/2.300/0.100 ms
```

Why this matters: a report that says "the relay station is unreachable" is weaker than one that says "the relay station is unreachable **while every other host I tested answers normally**." The second version has already ruled out the boring explanations, and it's the difference between a ticket that gets acted on and one that gets handed back to you.

### Step 5 — Capture Your Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Take a screenshot of your simulator session showing your evidence trail — at minimum the failed ping by name, the successful `dig`, the failed ping by IP, and the failed traceroute. **This screenshot is required.** Name it `cli-grid-outage.png`. You'll upload it and record its filename via the GitHub Commit section below.

An incident note with no attached evidence is just an opinion. This is the attachment.

---

## Part E — Write the Finding

This is the part that makes you a security professional rather than someone who can run commands.

Everything you've done so far is raw evidence. Nobody upstream of you — not your team lead, not the Foundry staff who filed the ticket, not the person who picks this up on the next shift — is going to read six terminal outputs and work out the conclusion themselves. Your job is to hand them the conclusion **and** the reason to believe it.

This is your first incident-report rep. You will do many more; Week 12's capstone asks you to write these for real. So we're giving you the structure now, while the stakes are low. Fill in each field — this is not a blank page, it's a form, and every professional incident note answers these same four questions.

**Keep it short and specific.** A good finding is a paragraph, not an essay. Write what you can defend.

### Step 1 — What Is Broken

One or two sentences. Name the specific thing that is not working. Be precise about *what* is down — not "the network," not "the relay station area," but the actual component your evidence points at.

Your statement of what is broken:

```
The relay-station host at 10.20.5.30 is not responsive to ICMP ping requests. The evidence points to this specific computer as the problem, not the entire Grid or network. 
```

### Step 2 — What Evidence Proves It

List the specific tests you ran and what each one returned. This is where your Parts B and C outputs earn their keep. Someone reading this should be able to re-run your tests and reach the same conclusion without asking you a single question.

Your evidence, test by test:

```
1. Pinged relay-station.grid.local. The name resolved to 10.20.5.30, however, there was a 100% packet loss.
2. Utilized dig relay-station.grid.local. DNS successfully returned 10.20.5.30 with a NOERROR status.
3. Pinged 10.20.5.30. There was 100% packet loss, demonstrating the problem was not caused by the hostname. 
4. Tracerouted relay-station.grid.local. The trace reached grid-gateway (10.20.5.1) at hop 1, but received no responses from hops 2 to 8.
5. Pinged foundry-archive.grid.local as a control test. It resolved to 10.20.5.20 and received all 4 replies with 0% packet loss and an average response time of 2.150 ms, showing that this host and the tested network path are working. 

```

### Step 3 — What You Ruled Out, and How

Just as important as what you found. Say explicitly which possible causes you eliminated and which specific test eliminated each one. At minimum, address: your own workstation, your local network path out, name resolution, and the colleague's theory.

Ruling out possibilities is what separates a finding from a guess. A reader who sees only your conclusion has to trust you. A reader who sees what you eliminated can *check* you.

What you ruled out and the evidence that ruled it out:

```
1.Own workstation: The control test to foundry-archive.grid.local received all 4 replies with 0% packet loss and an average RTT of 2.150 ms. This evidence demonstrates that my workstation is able to send and receive network traffic.
2.My local network path: The traceroute to relay-station.grid.local successfully reached grid-gateway (10.20.5.1) at hop 1. This demonstrates that my workstation reached the local gateway.
3.Name resolution (DNS): Implemented dig relay-station.grid.local and it returned 10.20.5.30 and received 100% packet loss. Since the same failure occurred without using the hostname, DNS or hostname is not suspect. 
4.Colleague's theory: I pinged 10.20.5.30 directly and still received 100% packet loss. Since the same failure happened without using the hostname, the problem is not caused by DNS or the hostname.
5.Gateway connectivity: I pinged 10.20.5.1 and received all 4 replies with 0% packet loss and an average RTT of 1.150 ms. This demonstrates that my workstation can successfully communicate with the Grid gateway, so the connection between my workstation and the gateway is working. 
```

### Step 4 — What Should Happen Next

One or two sentences. Based on your finding, who or what needs to be looked at, and by whom? You don't have the access to fix this yourself — and that's normal. Knowing exactly what to escalate, and to whom, is the deliverable.

Your recommended next step:

```
Since we can send packets directly to the IP address but receive no replies, we should investigate the relay-station host (10.20.5.30), its firewall setting, and the network path to the hose. The issue should be escalated to individuals who may have access to the relay station's connection and firewall settings. 
```

---

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part B you pinged the target by name and then by IP. Explain why running *both* is necessary — describe what a person would wrongly conclude if they had run only the by-name test and stopped there. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Running both tests is important because pinging by name checks whether the computer can find the IP address and whether the host responds, while pinging by IP tests the host without using the name. If I only pinged the name and got no response, I might wrongly think DNS was the problem. By using the IP directly and getting the same result, I knew the problem was not the same. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** A name that returns "Name or service not known" and a name that resolves fine but never replies to a ping are two different failures with two different causes. Describe each one in plain English — what is actually going wrong in each case — and explain why treating them as the same problem would send a troubleshooter down the wrong path. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
"Name or service not known" means that the computer could not find an IP address for that name, so it does not know where exactly to send the packet. If the name resolves correctly but there is no ping response, the computer knows where the host is, but nobody is answering. Treating them as the same problem could mistakenly blur what the actual issue is, such as the host, firewall, or network path. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part A asked you to confirm your own address and your gateway before touching the reported problem at all — even though the ticket had nothing to do with your workstation. Defend that step to a colleague who thinks it's a waste of time on an urgent ticket. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The reason why its important to confirm your own address and gateway before touching the reported problem is to ensure your own computer and connection are working first. My workstation successfully reached the gateway at 10.20.5.1 and communicated with foundry-archive, which helped ruled out an issue with my own computer. This allows me to focus the investigation on the relay-station host and its connectivity instead of spending time investigating a problem that is not on my workstation. As a cybersecurity professional, this helps narrow down where a problem is instead of relying on guesses and escalating inaccurate conclusions. 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Your colleague was confident, possibly senior, and wrong. Describe how you decided their theory was wrong, and what you think that says about how much weight confidence should carry compared to evidence in security work. Where relevant, consider what would have happened if you had simply accepted their theory and reported it upward. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Although I would respect my colleague's experience, I would still verify their theory using evidence I've encountered. I tested the hostname with dig, which showed that relay-station.grid.local correctly resolved to 10.20.5.30, and then I pinged 10.20.5.30 and received 100% packet loss. This evidence demonstrated that DNS was not the cause, so if I had escalated the theory, the team could have spent time investigating the incorrect issue instead of looking deep into the relay-station host or connectivity. 
```

5. Record the filename below so your grader knows to look for it.

The screenshot filename you uploaded:

```
https://github.com/sudoyae/yaerelin-molina-cyberfoundations-portfolio/blob/main/assets/screenshots/week-05/cli-grid-outage.png?raw=true
```

Your screenshot lives in `assets/screenshots/week-05/` in your repository, alongside the rest of your Week 5 evidence. It does not need to be linked inside this worksheet.
